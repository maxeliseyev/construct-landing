# AGENTS.md — construct-landing

These instructions apply to GitHub Copilot, Codex, OpenCode, and similar coding agents working in this repository.

## Documentation & session notes

All docs live in `~/Code/construct-docs` (Obsidian vault, flat domain folders:
`architecture/ backend/ client/ cryptocore/ security/ decisions/ sessions/ …`).
**The vault's `AGENTS.md` is authoritative** for structure and writing rules — read it before
contributing docs. If a path is missing, search the domain folder rather than trusting old links.

After any session with architectural changes, design decisions, root-cause analysis, or
non-obvious choices:

1. Write a session note `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (sections: Context / What Changed /
   **Why** / Decisions / Open Questions) — `## Why` with rejected alternatives is mandatory.
2. If it constrains future work, add/update `decisions/<slug>.md`.
3. Patch the affected spec in its domain folder in the **same** session.
4. Append one line to `~/Code/construct-docs/log.md`: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] note | <topic>`.

Session notes are plain markdown, no YAML frontmatter; `[[wikilinks]]` to other notes are welcome.
Before creating a note, search for an existing one and extend it rather than duplicating.

Prefer the vault over ad-hoc markdown files in this repository unless repo-local docs are
explicitly requested.
